## Plasma Waves in General Dielectric Media

We're going to start by discussing the transition from the microscopic Maxwell formulation to the macro. To do that we'll need to discuss
- What polarization is and how electric polarization works
- Magnetization of a material
- We'll talk about the constitutive relations we'll encounter in this subject. Constitutive relations are relations between two kinds of field. For example, the relationship between the polarization and the electric field \\( P = \Chi E \\), or Ohm's law \\( j = \sigma E \\)
- Discuss the time-dependent and frequency-dependent behavior in relation to the convolution theorem
- Poynting's theorem and energy conservation
- Conductivity and resistivity
- A simple classical model of damped simple harmonic motion

### Electric Polarization

The most basic interaction between the electromagnetic force and matter is electric polarization. If we consider a solid or other form of matter and apply an external electric field, what happens? Zooming in at a microscopic level of the material, we know the material is made of atoms which look like clusters of positive and negative charges that are bound together. In the presence of an external electric field, the positive and negative charges will separate, creating an opposite electric field to balance the externally applied field.

When the positive and negative charges are displaced by the external electric field, a dipole electric field develops between them. The dipole electric field is the field of an electric dipole (duh). An ideal electric dipole is the limit of the field due to two charges \\( \pm q \\) separated by a distance \\( \vec d \\) as \\( d \rightarrow 0 \\). We define the dipole moment \\( \vec p \\) of an electric dipole as:

\vec p = q \vec d

In a polarized solid, we define a polarization density

\vec P \equiv \dv{\vec p}{V} \sim \dv{q}{V} \vec \Delta

which is like a charge density \\( \dv{q}{V} \\) times some average separation distance.
