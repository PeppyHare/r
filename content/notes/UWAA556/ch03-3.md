# Waves in Hot Magnetized Plasma

Just like in the cold plasma dispersion relation, finding the dielectric tensor helps with the dispersion relation. The process involves multiple steps. We will only look at the overview here.

The process utilizes the method of characteristics, where the perturbation of \\( f(\vec v) \\) due to the wave is found by integrating along unperturbed orbits. Note: the orbits will be spirals, \\( \vec R(t) = \vec R(\vec x(t), \vec v(t), t) \\). The steps of the process are:

- Calculate \\( \left. \dv{f}{t} \right|_{\vec R} \\) which is the change in the distribution function along this trajectory.
- Linearize the evolution equation with \\( \vec E = \vec E_1 \\) and \\( \vec B = \vec B_0 + \vec B_1 \\)
- Express the perturbations as Fourier expansions
- Integrate the equation of motion for the particles, and get expressions for the particl velocity
- Calculate \\( \vec J = q \int \vec v f_1 \dd \vec v \\)
- Use \\( \vec J = \vec \sigma \cdot \vec E \\) and \\( \vec \epsilon = \vec \epsilon_b + i \vec \sigma / \omega \\) to construct the effective dielectric tensor \\( \vec K = \vec \epsilon / \epsilon_0 \\)

We will, as usual, use a coordinate system such that \\( \vec B_0 = B_0 \vu z \\). We define \\( \psi \\) to be the angle made by \\( \vec k \\) in the x-y plane:

k_x = k_\perp \cos \psi \qquad k_y = k _\perp \sin \psi
