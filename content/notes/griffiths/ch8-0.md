# 8.0: Phys 544 Introduction


## Author Notes

From here on out, the text will be based on the lecture content, not on the Griffiths textbook. The class will follow the 4th edition pretty closely, but there will definitely be some differences. Hope I don't get too much wrong!

## Course Structure

We've got some real homework this time!

 - 33% Homework, more or less weekly
 - 33% Midterm. 1 hour, closed-book
 - 33% Final + presentation. Topic should be related to EM radiation applications. It'll be a ~10 minute presentation and a 4-page paper.


For homework, either email it by Thursday 5pm, or preferably just hand it in on Wednesday evening during class.
