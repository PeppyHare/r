# Finite Difference and Finite Volume Methods

Finite volume methods can easily handle arbitrary geometries. You can use arbitrarily shaped cells, irregular meshes, and even unstructured meshes. With an irregular mesh, the cell shapes can distort. In an unstructured mesh, the cell shape can even change. Why would you ever want that, you may ask? Consider a circular shape in the middle of our domain. We'll have a pretty hard time fitting a regular or even irregular mesh to a circle.

## Differential Operators

Starting with a 2-dimensional domain, the divergence operator can be discretized as


{{< katex display >}}
\div F = \pdv{F_x}{x} + \pdv{F_y}{y} = \frac{F_{x_{i+1, j}} - F_{x _{i-1, j}}}{2 \Delta x} + \frac{ F_{y_{i, j+1}} - F_{y _{i, j-1}}}{2 \Delta y}
{{< /katex >}}


In a finite volume method, we need to integrate the differential operators over a cell volume



{{< katex display >}}
\int_V \div \vec{F} \dd V = \oint \vec{\dd S} \cdot \vec{F}
{{< /katex >}}


{{< katex display >}}
= \sum_{\text{faces}} \vec{F} \cdot \vec{\dd S}
{{< /katex >}}


{{< katex display >}}
= F_{x_{i+1/2}} + \dd S_{x_{i+1/2}} + F_{y_{j+1/2}} \dd S _{u_{j+1/2}} + F_{x_{i-1/2}} + \dd S_{x_{i-1/2}} 
{{< /katex >}}

If you have an orthogonal regular grid, \\( \dd V_{ijk} = \Delta x \Delta y \Delta z \\), then 

{{< katex display >}}
\dd S_{x_{i+1/2}} = \Delta y \Delta z
{{< /katex >}}


{{< katex display >}}
F_{x_{i+1/2}} = \frac{F_x i + F_{x_{i+1}}}{2}
{{< /katex >}}

and the same for other terms, then \\( \dd V_{ijk} \\) reduces to the finite difference operator and the finite volume method is exactly equivalent to the finite difference method. In this sense, finite volume algorithms are simply a straightforward extension of finite difference algorithms, where instead of simply looking ahead/behind by some amount \\( \Delta x \\), we must here take the appropriate dot products to calculate fluxes across faces of oddly-shaped cells. We get to maintain the conservation form

\pdv{Q}{t} = \div F = 0

while using finite difference methods. Finite volume methods are some of the most popular for commercial CFD codes.


<!-- Questions for next class:

 - Project 3.2: when we set the initial value at t=0 and we have periodic boundary conditions set, are we supposed to wrap the function around the boundary or just evaluate it on the given interval?
    just apply boundary conditions after each step
    you can also set an integer jp1 = 1 + mod(j, jmax) so u_j+1 = u(jp1) and u_j-1 = u(jm1) where jm1 = jmax - mod(jmax + 1 - j, jmax)
 - Project 3.2: Is the step function a regular heaviside step function, or a finite-width square wave like the one in project 1? If it's step, how are we supposed to manage periodic boundary conditions? -->



The modified PDE gives the accuracy from the leading order error term, e.g. \\( O(\Delta x ^2 \\). Because of the way we expand our Taylor series, the leading order error term tends to look like


{{< katex display >}}
\propto \pdv{^3 u}{x^3} \Delta x^2
{{< /katex >}}


{{< katex display >}}
\propto \pdv{^2 u}{x^2} \Delta x
{{< /katex >}}


One thing we know about wave PDEs is that adding a term with an odd order derivative will introduce dispersive effects, and adding a term with an even order derivative will add diffusive (viscous) effects.
