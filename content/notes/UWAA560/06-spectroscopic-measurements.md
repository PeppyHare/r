# Spectroscopic Measurements

## Plasma Self-Emission

Plasmas emit light (electromagnetic radiation) over a broad range of wavelengths. This can be from the X-ray to UV to visible to IR. The emission depends on the plasma constituents, magnetic field, and plasma properties \\( n_e, T_e, T_i, \vec v_i \\). We should be able to analyze the self-emission to provide a measurements of these properties. These measurements are both rich in information, and completely non-perturbing. Unfortunately, extracting plasma properties from measurements can be extremely complicated, since the emission is influenced by all of these effects together.
