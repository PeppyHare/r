These are my notes. Please read them.

All content is written in Markdown and rendered to a static site using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The theme for the site is [hugo-book](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-book/). I use KaTeX to typeset any LaTeX in my source in the browser super fast (and in a mobile-friendly format!).
