These are my notes. Have a gander if you please.

I write content Markdown and render it to a static site using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The lovely minimal theme for the site is [hugo-book](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book). I use KaTeX to typeset any LaTeX in my source in the browser super fast (and sometimes even in a mobile-friendly format!).
