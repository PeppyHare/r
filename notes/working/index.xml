\[\phi(r) = \frac{-e}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r} e ^{- r / \lambda_D}\] where the Debye length is \( \lambda_D = \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_0 T_e}{ n_e e}} \) . The mean free path between large-angle collisions is estimated as
\[\lambda_{mfp} \sim \frac{\epsilon_0 T_e ^2}{\phi_e n_e \log ( \Lambda)}\] where \(\phi_e = e^2 / 4 \pi \epsilon_0\) are the constants from the Coulomb force law.</description></item><item><title>Datta (2021)</title><link>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/working/datta2021/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/working/datta2021/</guid><description>\[\] A Domain-Hybridized Plasma Model Using Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Elements # Models # Keep in mind that the behavior of a plasma is primarily determined by the ratio between a spatial length of interest and the following reference lengths. The appropriate model for describing a plasma depends on the regime defined by these lengths.
Reference length Degree of magnetization Larmor radius \( r_L \) Charge separation Debye length \( \lambda_D \) Collisionality Mean free path \( \lambda_{mfp} \) Continuum Kinetic Model # The continuum kinetic model is the most complete description, taking into account the forces acting upon each particle:</description></item><item><title>Goedbloed (2019)</title><link>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/working/goedbloed/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/working/goedbloed/</guid><description>\[\] Thermonuclear fusion and plasma confinement # Nuclear reactions release net energy if there is a mass defect, i.e. if
\[(m_A) &amp;#43; m_B) c ^2 &amp;gt; (m_C &amp;#43; m_D) c^2\] In laboratory fusion, hydrogen isotopes are considered, where the deuterium-tritium reaction is the most promising one for future reactors:
\[D^2 &amp;#43; T^3 \rightarrow He ^4 (3.5 MeV) &amp;#43; n (14.1 MeV)\] This yields two kinds of products, viz. \( \alpha \) particles which are charged so that they can be captured by a confining magnetic field, and neutrons which are electrically neutral so that they can escape from the magnetic configuration.</description></item></channel></rss>
