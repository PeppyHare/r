Fourier Series / Spectral Analysis # First, let&amp;rsquo;s not get confused between Fourier series and Fourier transforms. A Fourier series is the breakdown of a function defined on a finite interval into &amp;ldquo;frequency components.&amp;rdquo; For example, if we have \( f(x) : x \in [a, b] \), a Fourier series for \( f(x) \) pulls apart the discrete frequency components of the \( e^{ikx} \) modes that make up the function.</description></item><item><title>Plasma Waves in General Dielectric Media</title><link>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA556/ch02-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA556/ch02-1/</guid><description>\[\] Plasma Waves in General Dielectric Media # We&amp;rsquo;re going to start by discussing the transition from the microscopic Maxwell formulation to the macro.

What polarization is and how electric polarization works Magnetization of a material We&amp;rsquo;ll talk about the constitutive relations we&amp;rsquo;ll encounter in this subject. Constitutive relations are relations between two kinds of field. For example, the relationship between the polarization and the electric field \( P = \Chi E \), or Ohm&amp;rsquo;s law \( j = \sigma E \) Discuss the time-dependent and frequency-dependent behavior in relation to the convolution theorem Poynting&amp;rsquo;s theorem and energy conservation Conductivity and resistivity A simple classical model of a dielectric displacement as a bound oscillator (damped simple harmonic motion) Electric Polarization # The simplest interaction between the electromagnetic force and physical matter is electric polarization.</description></item><item><title>Wave Properties in Cold Unmagnetized Plasma</title><link>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA556/ch02-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA556/ch02-2/</guid><description>\[\] Wave Properties in Cold Unmagnetized Plasma # Before we can get to the wave properties, we first need to be specific about what we mean by a &amp;ldquo;cold&amp;rdquo; plasma. In the fluid formulation, we have a few central equations:
Conservation of matter \[\pdv{n}{t} &amp;#43; \div (n \vec v) = 0\] Conservation of momentum \[\pdv{}{t} (m n \vec v) &amp;#43; \div (m n \vec v \vec v) = \sum \text{Force densities}\] Energy conservation \[\pdv{e}{t} &amp;#43; \div (e \vec v) = \sum \text{Energy sources}\] For plasma waves, we are generally interested in the momentum equation.</description></item><item><title>Cold Magnetized Plasma Dispersion Relation</title><link>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA556/ch02-3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA556/ch02-3/</guid><description>\[\] Cold Magnetized Plasma Dispersion Relation # Now that we have a pretty good handle on the unmagnetized case, let&amp;rsquo;s include the background magnetic field \( \vec B_0 \) in the linearized equation of motion \[m_\alpha \pdv{\vec v_{\alpha, 1}}{t} = q_\alpha (\vec E_1 &amp;#43; \vec v_{\alpha, 1} \cross \vec B_0)\] We define \( \vec \omega_{c, \alpha} \) to be the vector gyrofrequency \[\vec \omega_{c, \alpha} \equiv \frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha} \vec B_0\] \[\pdv{\vec v_{\alpha, 1}}{t} &amp;#43; \vec \omega_{c, \alpha} \cross \vec v_{\alpha, 1} = \frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha} \vec E_1\] For a linear system like this, where \( Av = F \), in general the generic solutions are perturbations to the solutions of the homogeneous equation \( Av = 0 \).</description></item><item><title>The CMA Diagram</title><link>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA556/ch02-4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA556/ch02-4/</guid><description>\[\] The CMA Diagram # In the previous section, we derived the dispersion relation for a cold uniform magnetized plasma:

\[\tan ^2 \theta = - \frac{P (n^2 - R)(n^2 - L)}{(Sn^2 - RL)(n^2 - P)}\] where \( n \) is the index of refraction, \( P \), \( R \), \( L \), \( S \), and \( D \) are the Stix parameters, \( \theta \) is the angle between \( \vec k \) and \( \vec B_0 \).</description></item><item><title>Introduction to Kinetic Theory</title><link>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA556/ch03-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA556/ch03-1/</guid><description>\[\] Timescale Hierarchy # What happens to a perturbation in a plasma comprised of \( N \) particles, each with independent \( \vec x \) and \( \vec v \)? The timescales that define the statistical equilibria define some different regimes.
On the timescale of the plasma frequency (\( 1 / \omega_p \)), Coulomb potentials are shielded within the region of a Debye sphere. This is the fastest timescale that&amp;rsquo;s relevant to plasma dynamics, because it is the speed at which electrons can move.</description></item><item><title>Landau Damping</title><link>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA556/ch03-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA556/ch03-2/</guid><description>\[\] Landau Damping # The electrostatic dispersion relation for a plasma with a non-zero temperature leads to additional terms beyond the \( \omega^2 - \omega_p ^2 = 0 \) relation we got before.
Waves in Thermal, Unmagnetized Plasma using Vlasov Equations # In a uniform plasma with \( T &amp;gt; 0 \), \( \vec E_0 = \vec B_0 = 0 \) and equilibrium distribution function \( f_0 (\vec v) \), a perturbation in \( f(\vec x, \vec v, t) \) can be written as</description></item><item><title>Waves in Hot Magnetized Plasma</title><link>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA556/ch03-3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA556/ch03-3/</guid><description>\[\] Waves in Hot Magnetized Plasma # Just like in the cold plasma dispersion relation, finding the dielectric tensor helps with the dispersion relation. The process involves multiple steps. We will only look at the overview here.
The process utilizes the method of characteristics, where the perturbation of \( f(\vec v) \) due to the wave is found by integrating along unperturbed orbits. Note: the orbits will be spirals, \( \vec R(t) = \vec R(\vec x(t), \vec v(t), t) \).</description></item><item><title>Fluid stuff</title><link>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA556/ch04-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA556/ch04-1/</guid><description>\[\] Fluid Theory # Recall that cold plasma theory assumed no finite temperature effects. We then added individual particle contributions to find quantities like currents.
In kinetic theory, we start from the full particle distribution function with a finite temperature, which considers a meaningful velocity distribution function. We considered waves with phase velocities such that we could not just &amp;ldquo;lump particles together&amp;rdquo; because \( |v_x - v_\phi| \) has a significant effect on wave propagation (e.</description></item><item><title>Quasi-Linear Theory</title><link>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA556/ch04-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA556/ch04-2/</guid><description>\[\] Quasi-Linear Theory # (Goldston and Rutherford, Chapter 25 is a good reference)
From kinetic theory, we saw that instabilities can develop when a wave is resonant with particles in an appropriate region of the velocity distribution function. This is essentially the reverse of Landau damping (&amp;ldquo;inverse Landau damping&amp;rdquo;).
We saw an example of the &amp;ldquo;bump-on-tail&amp;rdquo; instability, where we have a distribution where there is a high-energy population that causes \( \partial f / \partial v \) to be positive for certain values of \( \omega / k \).</description></item><item><title>Diffusion and Resistivity</title><link>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA556/ch05-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA556/ch05-1/</guid><description>\[\] Diffusion and Resistivity # Diffusion is a migration of particles that results in neutralization of any density gradients. Collisional processes affect the rate of diffusion. For example, particle random walks due to collisions can destroy plasma confinement.
For net energy gain in a confined fusion reaction, we must meet the Lawson criterion for a confinement time \( \tau \):
\[n \tau &amp;gt; 10^{14} \text{s}/ \text{cm}^{3}\] It is really hard to maintain a highly dense plasma for a long confinement time.</description></item></channel></rss>
