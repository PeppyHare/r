Fourier Series / Spectral Analysis # First, let&amp;rsquo;s not get confused between Fourier series and Fourier transforms. A Fourier series is the breakdown of a function defined on a finite interval into &amp;ldquo;frequency components.&amp;rdquo; For example, if we have \( f(x) : x \in [a, b] \), a Fourier series for \( f(x) \) pulls apart the discrete frequency components of the \( e^{ikx} \) modes that make up the function.</description></item><item><title>Plasma Waves in General Dielectric Media</title><link>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA556/ch02-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA556/ch02-1/</guid><description>\[\] Plasma Waves in General Dielectric Media # We&amp;rsquo;re going to start by discussing the transition from the microscopic Maxwell formulation to the macro. To do that we&amp;rsquo;ll need to discuss
What polarization is and how electric polarization works Magnetization of a material We&amp;rsquo;ll talk about the constitutive relations we&amp;rsquo;ll encounter in this subject. Constitutive relations are relations between two kinds of field. For example, the relationship between the polarization and the electric field \( P = \Chi E \), or Ohm&amp;rsquo;s law \( j = \sigma E \) Discuss the time-dependent and frequency-dependent behavior in relation to the convolution theorem Poynting&amp;rsquo;s theorem and energy conservation Conductivity and resistivity A simple classical model of a dielectric displacement as a bound oscillator (damped simple harmonic motion) Electric Polarization # The simplest interaction between the electromagnetic force and physical matter is electric polarization.</description></item><item><title>Wave Properties in Cold Unmagnetized Plasma</title><link>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA556/ch02-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA556/ch02-2/</guid><description>\[\] Wave Properties in Cold Unmagnetized Plasma # Before we can get to the wave properties, we first need to be specific about what we mean by a &amp;ldquo;cold&amp;rdquo; plasma. In the fluid formulation, we have a few central equations:
Conservation of matter \[\pdv{n}{t} &amp;#43; \div (n \vec v) = 0\] Conservation of momentum \[\pdv{}{t} (m n \vec v) &amp;#43; \div (m n \vec v \vec v) = \sum \text{Force densities}\] Energy conservation \[\pdv{e}{t} &amp;#43; \div (e \vec v) = \sum \text{Energy sources}\] For plasma waves, we are generally interested in the momentum equation.</description></item></channel></rss>
