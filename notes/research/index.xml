Closed Integral Form of Dispersion Relation # Iman&amp;rsquo;s done a great job deriving a closed-form integral representation of the dispersion relation for the Dory-Guest-Harris instability. The trick to computing solutions to the dispersion relation is in getting all of the the normalization correct and computing the correct quadrature across both integrals (over $v_\perp$ and $\theta$).</description></item><item><title>Getting Started with WARPXM</title><link>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/research/warpxm-101/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/research/warpxm-101/</guid><description>What is WARPXM # WARPXM is a framework for solving hyperbolic systems. Here &amp;ldquo;framework&amp;rdquo; means that it is not a single tool for solving a particular system, but rather it contains a large number of applications, solvers, and other tools which can be combined to simulate a wide variety of systems.
Installation # Prerequisites: WARPXM # Building the warpxm executable itself is the most important part. It is a C++ project which uses CMake as the build system.</description></item></channel></rss>
