We need an arithmetic to describe quantities like this, which evidently do not add in the ordinary way. The reason they don&amp;rsquo;t, of course, is that displacements (straight line segments going from one point to another) have direction as well as magnitude (length), and it is essential to take both into account when you combine them.</description></item><item><title>Differential Calculus</title><link>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/griffiths/ch1-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/griffiths/ch1-2/</guid><description>1.2: Differential Calculus # 1.2.1: &amp;ldquo;Ordinary&amp;rdquo; Derivatives # Suppose we have a function of one variable, \( f(x) \).

Suppose some quantity &amp;ldquo;\( f \)&amp;rdquo; is propagating with speed \( v \) in the \( +z \) direction, and we focus on sinusoidal &amp;ldquo;disturbances.</description></item><item><title>Wave Equation for E and B</title><link>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/griffiths/ch9-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/griffiths/ch9-2/</guid><description>9.2.1 Wave Equation for E and B # Recall Maxwell&amp;rsquo;s equations
