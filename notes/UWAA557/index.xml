Rule 1 In event counting measurements the uncertainty in event rate is equal to the square root of the number of events detected. A trade off is made between signal resolution and time resolution Rule 2 The total E and M force on a volume of plasma can be computed from surface values through \( \vec F = \int \overline{T} \cdot \vec n \dd V \) Rule 3 Magnetic field has a tension and isotropic pressure</description></item><item><title>Statistical Mechanics</title><link>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA557/ch10-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA557/ch10-1/</guid><description>10-1 Statistical Mechanics # 10.1.1 Very Large Numbers # Before getting started with real plasma physics concepts, we need to quickly review some statistical mechanics with the goal of deriving the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.
As we all know, if we have \( N \) unique objects, there are \( N! \) ways of arranging them. If \( n_1 \ldots n_k \) are identical with N things, the number of combinations is</description></item><item><title>Review of E&amp;M</title><link>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA557/ch10-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA557/ch10-2/</guid><description>10.2 Review of E&amp;amp;M # Homework group: just me n leek42@uw.edu

10.1.1 Maxwell Stress Tensor # The Maxwell stress tensor encompasses the way that electromagnetic fields an exert forces/stresses in 3D space:
\[\vec p = \text{ momentum }\] The basic force laws of E&amp;amp;M are
\[\dv{\vec p}{t} = q \left( \vec E &amp;#43; \vec v \cross \vec B \right)\] On an element of volume, the change in momentum is</description></item><item><title>Lagrange Multipliers</title><link>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA557/ch10-3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA557/ch10-3/</guid><description>Lagrange Multipliers # When we have a problem of variation where one function is maximized or minimized subject to a constraint imposed by another function

What are the properties of the plasma (both electrons and ions) at the wall? The speed of a particle headed towards the wall is
\[\frac{1}{2} m v_{th} ^2 \approx \frac{1}{2} kT \rightarrow v_{th} \approx \sqrt{ \frac{kT}{m}}\] Since electrons are much lighter than ions (\( m_e = m_i / 1800 \) for hydrogen), they are moving much faster and will leave the plasma at a much higher rate than the ions.</description></item><item><title>Collisions</title><link>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA557/ch11-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA557/ch11-2/</guid><description>Collisions # If \( \Lambda \) is large, then small-angle scattering dominates.

You can stay on the g=1 curve by putting a large resistor on your power supply, so it&amp;rsquo;s always running like it&amp;rsquo;s about to break down.

One way to see how the electron fluid oscillates, take a region of plasma and displace the electrons by a distance \( x \) and release. Then, watch how the electrons oscillate.
Gauss&amp;rsquo;s law gives the resulting electric field (same as a parallel-plate capacitor.
