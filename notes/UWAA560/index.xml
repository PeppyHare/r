To teach the function of diagnostic components, and the specific plasma mechanisms that are being measured. You will be come familiar with the analysis procedures required to get (often indirect) measurements. To appreciate uncertainty and error quantification in reporting experimental measurements. This course will use I.H. Hutchinson, Principles of Plasma Diagnostics as the primary text, with the standard R.J. Goldston and P.</description></item><item><title>General Diagnostic Considerations</title><link>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA560/02-diagnostic-considerations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA560/02-diagnostic-considerations/</guid><description>General Diagnostic Considerations # \[\] First, let us categorize some broad categories of items to consider when we think about plasma diagnostics by asking a few questions:
Which plasma properties do we want to measure?
Densities for individual species, velocity, temperature (moment measurements). In the case where a plasma is not thermal (Maxwellian), we may need to measure species distribution function \( f_s (\vec v) \) Plasma content, i.e. species concentrations, \( Z_{eff} \) (which is a determining factor in resistivity and radiation power) Plasma currents, current densities, electromagnetic fields.</description></item><item><title>Magnetic Field Diagnostics</title><link>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA560/03-magnetic-field-diagnostics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA560/03-magnetic-field-diagnostics/</guid><description>B-dot Probe Diagnostics # Faraday&amp;rsquo;s law is the basis for magnetic field coils:
\[\int \pdv{\vec B}{t} \cdot \dd \vec S = - \oint \vec E \cdot \dd \vec l = - V_{emf}\] For a rigid, perfectly conducting loop of N turns in the presence of a changing magnetic field,
\[V_i = \oint \vec E \cdot \dd \vec l = - \pdv{\Phi}{t} = - \pdv{}{t} \int \vec B \cdot \dd \vec s = - N A \frac{\int \pdv{\vec B}{t} \cdot \dd \vec s}{\int \dd \vec s} \\ \rightarrow V_i \propto \dot{B_{avg}}\] where \( B_{avg} \) is the area-averaged magnetic field aligned to loop.</description></item><item><title>Electrostatic Diagnostics</title><link>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA560/04-electrostatic-diagnostics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA560/04-electrostatic-diagnostics/</guid><description>\[\] Langmuir Probes # Langmuir probes are the oldest and simplest plasma diagnostic: You simply insert an electrode into the plasma and measure the \( I \)-\( V \) curve. Doing so is fairly simple, but the probe measurements are often difficult to interpret, since extracting accurate plasma properties from measurements can be challenging.
Consider a probe inserted into a steady-state plasma. We assume that there is an electrode (e.</description></item><item><title>Index of Refraction Measurements</title><link>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA560/05-index-of-refraction-measurements/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA560/05-index-of-refraction-measurements/</guid><description>\[\] Index of Refraction Measurements # The refractive index is defined as the speed of light (in vacuum) over the phase velocity \( n = \frac{c}{v_{\phi}} \), \( v_\phi = \omega / k \). Recall that in vacuum the phase velocity is just the speed of light (\( n = 1 \) in vacuum). In a plasma, we know that the dispersion relation will be substantially different.
In most materials, \( n &amp;gt; 1 \), but from our crude diagram we can expect plasmas to have \( n &amp;lt; 1 \).</description></item><item><title>Spectroscopic Measurements</title><link>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA560/06-spectroscopic-measurements/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA560/06-spectroscopic-measurements/</guid><description>\[\] Spectroscopic Measurements # Plasma Self-Emission # Plasmas emit light (electromagnetic radiation) over a broad range of wavelengths. This can be from the X-ray to UV to visible to IR. The emission depends on the plasma constituents, magnetic field, and plasma properties \( n_e, T_e, T_i, \vec v_i \). We should be able to analyze the self-emission to provide a measurements of these properties. These measurements are both rich in information, and completely non-perturbing.</description></item><item><title>Student Lectures</title><link>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA560/90-student-lectures/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA560/90-student-lectures/</guid><description>\[\] Particle Diagnostics: Neutron diagnostics (Aria Johansen) # Start from the basics: what is a neutron? It&amp;rsquo;s a spin \( 1/2 \) baryon which interacts with all forces. Primarily decays into usually an electron and an antielectron neutron as well as a proton. Another decay process with 1/1000 of intensity decays to gamma. Mass is \( 939.6 MeV/c^2 \), very comparable to proton.
Where do neutrons come from? They decay quite rapidly - 15 minute lifetime.</description></item><item><title>My class lecture</title><link>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA560/91-zeeman-spectroscopy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA560/91-zeeman-spectroscopy/</guid><description>\[\] Zeeman Spectroscopy # Motivation # In high-energy-density plasmas, the current density distribution is strongly tied to the magnetic field distribution, and in some regions measurement of the B-field is the only way to obtain current density measurements. The magnetic field also determines resistivity, plasma dynamics, and energy balance.
The diagnostic methods to measure localized magnetic fields in plasma make use of the Zeeman effect, the Stark effect, Faraday rotation, or Faraday&amp;rsquo;s law.</description></item><item><title>Formulary</title><link>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA560/formulary/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peppyhare.github.io/r/notes/UWAA560/formulary/</guid><description>\( \) Formulary # Kinetic Description
