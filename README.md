### Set-up after I forget how to

- Make sure to clone with submodules `git clone git@github.com:PeppyHare/r.git --recursive`
- Install hugo extended from source https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/#source
- Run dev server with `hugo server --minify`
- When commit is done, push to GitHub pages with `./gc.sh "A useful commit message goes here"`
